You're the one desire, but your love is burning like fire

I need some water, cause I'm getting so dry
Your love is burning like the sun in July
When you put your arms around me you raise the temperature high
Cause your love is burning like the sun in July.

Burning, just like the sun glowing, mmm
Shining, just like the love we have
Let me feel it, I wanna touch your skin, yeah
Let me kiss it, I wanna taste the sin, yeah.
